# ShoppingList0603

This is a simple application using Google Firebase client-side for a real-time collaborative shopping/item list. 

User's are required to sign in (using either Google or anonymously) and select a currency. They can then modify the shared shopping list unique to that currency. Items can only be edited and deleted if owned by the user.
